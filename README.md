I had to complete this for homework, but I am happy with how my take on the classic Computer Vision image blending problem turned out. Run "image-blending.ipynb" to see results. My persnal favorite is the apple and owl, thanks! "main.ipynb" also shows the image blending stuff, but it first shows me plotting some signal processing and fourier domain stuff, so feel free to ignore that
