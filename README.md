I had to complete this for homework, but I am happy with how my take on the classic Computer Vision image blending problem turned out. "main.ipynb"  shows the image blending stuff, but it first shows me plotting some signal processing and fourier domain stuff, so feel free to ignore that. Run "image-blending.ipynb" to see results. My persnal favorite is the apple and owl, thanks!
Also, there is an html file showing and explaining results
